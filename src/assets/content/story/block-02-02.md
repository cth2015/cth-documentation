## An alternative classroom plays by different rules: 

Be impatient. Donâ€™t wait until you know everything, but make something now
Be lazy. Google everything and use what others have learned before you
Be presumptuous. Show off what you learn, as early and as often as you can 

WHY: People have learnt what you are learning, take it and make something new
HOW: Use the fact that other people do what you do
WHAT:  Google everything + teach +  make
