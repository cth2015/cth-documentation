## The Alternative Classroom

Imagine two classrooms. In the first classroom, you see a teacher surrounded by students. <wasteful> In the second classroom, you see people. People who are teaching and learning from each other. <optimal use> Traditional education is modelled after the first classroom. Resources are wasted, and degrees become more and more expensive. 

On [date], in [Wassenaar] during [conference], Marijn Koolen and Jan Hein Hoogstad imagined their own classroom: a collaborative space where they would leverage the resources in our classroom by searching, sorting and sharing the knowledge of each person in that group. With a grant from [department] of the University of Amsterdam, they founded what would become Coding the Humanities.
