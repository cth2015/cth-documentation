  From its inception, the pilot was geared at involving public and private partners to promote the sharing and circulation of both hands-on practices and theoretical knowledge. Throughout the pilot, a number of experts visited:

  Jan Willem Tulp (http://tulpinteractive.com/about/) lectured and assisted the students over several days during the pilot. Tulp Interactive creates data visualizations; he “writes software to create data visualizations based on abstract data. (…)Data visualizations can be static or interactive, and can be delivered on the web in a browser, as a stand-alone desktop application, in print, as a projection, an interactive installation and more.” 

  Alexandro Mancusi (Weyeser) - Weyeser supports organizations to translate big amounts of data into knowledge by means of data mining, machine learning and visualization. Their solutions offer governments, governmental institutions, universities, think tanks and corporations ways of objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers. Within the framework of Coding the Humanities, Weyeser supports humanities students in the analysis and visualization of humanities' related governmental open data sets relevant to their research.

  Federico Bonelli (Trasformatorio.net) is a new media philosopher and practitioner with a background in science, history of mathematics and art. In a brief open-format workshop, he shared his experience in different fields of media creation and research, as well as his involvement in multimedia and hacking since the early nineties.

  Ashley Williams (Bocoup) from Open Web technology Bocoup visited the pilot three days. She lectured about her experiences with teaching programming to humanities researchers and how coding and the humanities enrich each other. Ashley Williams is a “former NYC Teaching Fellow, former lead instructor of the Flatiron School’s NYC Web Development Fellowship, and current instructor at Wesleyan University. She pairs a wealth of education background with a passion and prowess for web development” (Bocoup.com). In addition to this, presented Bocoup’s ideas about projects for the open web and collaborations between academia and private partners.

  > “I learned a lot from Ashley Williams when she came over from Boston to teach. (…) Ashley brought many of the scattered coding skills I had together in very simple exercises which gave me important insights in my actual progress and possible further development.”

  Strategic innovator/Innovation strategist Nigel Hamlin, introduced and advised on project management and control, but also acted as a general mentor to the students, advising on the issues that can and do arise in a software development environment. He also works with the team to further develop the ideas behind the course for future use.

  Lex Slaghuis and Arjan el Fassed from the Open State Foundation gave a presentation about open data and the use and sharing of information and data.

  Wolfgang Haas, Wolfgang Scheikl (CastYourArt) – Vienna-based CastYourArt is focused on consulting, production and online/offline distribution of audio and video material in which they present artists, exhibitions and collectors and take art out of the museum context.
