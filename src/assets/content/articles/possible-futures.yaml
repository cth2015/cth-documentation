  The Coding the Humanities pilot introduced students from the humanities faculty of the University of Amsterdam to the world of programming. The experiences offered by the pilot and the “Housemouse” project that formed the online result are the stepping stone for future Coding the Humanities endeavors.

  Currently, the team is working to establish more opportunities for students and researchers to engage in public-private-civic projects. The angle of “research through coding” offered by the Coding the Humanities team, offers companies and institutes the opportunity to articulate and solve problems, empower people through learning and teaching one another, with a specific focus on developing digital tools together.

  Key themes for future projects are empowerment through collaborative learning, the circulation of (tacit) knowledge to develop innovative ideas and the immediate practical application of insights through building together.

  Collaborations between different parties not only enriches research processes, it also proves to lead to more lasting partnerships; former students are part of the Coding the Humanities talent pool – some have already started a new career in coding as a result of the pilot while others have become involved in the initiation, project and process management of new projects for the Coding the Humanities team!
