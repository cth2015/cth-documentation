  Coding the Humanities is proud to present their pilot group and their project "House Mouse". Despite soaring temperatures and the ongoing World Cup, the group was present every day from early in the morning to late at night and not without result! Without further ado, we give the floor to the class of June, 2014.   
 
  ## From Pizza to Polymer
  We are a group of students from diverse disciplines within the UvA humanities, who came together in the early days of june to follow the pilot Coding the Humanities. Most of us were absolute beginners. A few had some very basic coding skills. Four weeks later, after loads of coffee, conceptualising, frustration, collaboration, pizzas, drinks, polymer elements, javascript workshops, presentations, grunt workshops, pitches, posters (the list could go on and on), the resulting [website](housemouse.codingthehumanities.com) is now our precious project.

  ## What Does House Mean to You?
  Our main project, called Project House Mouse, is a website that evolves around a typical humanities question: What does house mean to you? Although you may not be aware of it, each one of us has a different connotation to a basic concept like this. It's a seemingly simple question, yet it turns out to be complex to give a simple answer.

  On our [website](housemouse.codingthehumanities.com) the user is asked to answer this question by choosing one of the three images each representing a different type of house. The next step is to choose three images out of six that each represent an object that's closely related to the surroundings of a house. This user input is stored and integrated into the visualisation: a map of Europe that displays what type of house users from European countries chose. The website is built using [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), a new library that allows developers to write their own custom web components.  

  After this, the chosen concepts are used to perform a search in a dataset that the Dutch government has made public [openoverheid.org](openoverheid.org). The search looks for more information on these chosen concepts. A statistical table presents the choices correlated with the data from the dataset. The table shows how many working, semi working and broken links are found in the public dataset.

  There's only one question left: what does house mean to you?
