  At Coding the Humanities, we empower researchers to develop their own digital tools to perform research in the humanities. The initiative is based in Amsterdam, and was founded by Jan Hein Hoogstad and Marijn Koolen in April 2013. Early to 2014, Sabrina Sauer joined the core team. Jan Hein, Marijn and Sabrina all work as assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam (UvA).
  
  At present, the Coding the Humanities curriculum involves an MA course in the Cultural Analysis program (UvA), a BA course set up as part of a newly developed Digital Humanities minor (a joint effort of the UvA and the Vrije Universiteit), and a “crash course” for university employees.

  We cooperate with a number of public organisations and private companies (few examples?). Besides the sharing and circulation of knowledge, the cooperation between companies within both private and public sector provides added value to both; private and public partners are given fast access to research – to test and discover new ideas and products – while researchers retain access to current business and policy concerns.
  
  Agility and societal relevance – in the form of social innovation – are key to Coding the Humanities. We critically reflect on our own tools and practices, and work towards establishing a group of autonomous researchers both within and outside of the sphere of the university.
